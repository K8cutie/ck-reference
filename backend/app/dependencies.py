Shared FastAPI dependency helpers.

Right now we expose only `get_db`, which provides a SQLAlchemy
session to each request and makes sure itâ€™s closed afterward.

If you already have a `SessionLocal` factory elsewhere, just import
it here.  This keeps all routers consistent and avoids duplicate
code.
